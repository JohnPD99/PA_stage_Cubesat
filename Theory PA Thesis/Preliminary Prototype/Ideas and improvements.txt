Thermal:
1) make screw holes such that a heat sink can be attached
2) ask thermal team for advice
3) calculate # of vias such that enough heat gets transported away
4) What about top of IC --> connection to case?

Matching:
1) Use coplanar wave guide
2) isolate both amplifiers
3) isolate the different frequencies on whole board
4) Improve matching --> Problems with Qucs simulation

Power supply:
1) Look at suggestions from Armin

Devboard:
1) Conduct extensive tests


Other thoughts:
--> Possibly add more to the semester thesis --> Simulate how much coupling is on final Board
Achim suggests two boards?? --> Shouldn't one work? -> Investigate
